KCET Rank Prediction & College Recommendation Platform

An end-to-end, production-ready Machine Learning full-stack application that predicts KCET ranks and recommends realistic engineering colleges using historical cutoff data.

This project mirrors how real ML products are built, containerized, and deployed in industry, not just how models are trained in notebooks.

## Problem Statement

Students appearing for **KCET (Karnataka Common Entrance Test)** struggle to:

* Estimate their **expected rank** from exam marks
* Identify **realistic college options**
* Filter colleges by **branch, location, and type**

This platform solves these problems by:

* Predicting KCET rank using a trained ML model
* Recommending eligible colleges using historical cutoff data
* Providing a simple, intuitive UI for decision-making


### Design Principles Used

* Separation of Concerns
* Stateless APIs
* API-First Design
* Scalable & Cloud-Friendly Architecture


##  Machine Learning Pipeline

### Features Used

* KCET score (normalized)
* Board score (normalized)
* Exam year
* Total candidates appeared

### Pipeline

1. Feature Engineering
2. Standardization using `StandardScaler`
3. Supervised Regression Model
4. Post-prediction bias correction for real-world accuracy

### Output

* **Predicted KCET Rank**

> The pipeline reflects real exam dynamics, not just raw regression output.



## College Recommendation Engine

* Uses **real historical cutoff data (GM category)**
* Intelligent branch name matching (handles variations)
* Filters supported:

  * Branch
  * Location
  * College type
* Returns **only realistically achievable colleges**



##  Tech Stack

### Backend

* Python 3.11
* FastAPI
* Pydantic
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas, NumPy

### Frontend

* Streamlit
* Requests (API communication)

### DevOps & Deployment

* Docker & Docker Compose
* Environment-agnostic paths
* Stateless service design

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint          | Description           |
| ------ | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| POST   | `/predict`        | Predict KCET rank     |
| GET    | `/filters`        | Fetch filter options  |
| POST   | `/recommendation` | Get eligible colleges |


##  Dockerization

This project is **fully Dockerized** with **independent frontend and backend containers**.

### Why Docker?

* Consistent environments
* Easy cloud deployment
* Independent scaling
* No “works on my machine” issues



##  Run the Project Using Docker

### Prerequisites

* Docker
* Docker Compose

### Start the application

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

##  Run Locally (Without Docker)

### Backend

```bash
cd Backend
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn backend:app --reload
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd Frontend
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run frontend.py
```


##  Cloud Deployment Strategy

### Backend

* Render
* Railway
* AWS EC2 / ECS
* Any Docker-based platform

### Frontend

* Streamlit Cloud
* Vercel (via API proxy)
* Docker container

Frontend and backend can be **scaled independently**.
